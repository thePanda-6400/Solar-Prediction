# Solar-Prediction
Using Machine Learning to Predict Solar Power generation
This Project uses satellite data to predict solar power generation in certain areas

The first phase of the project uses weather and sensor data to predict the output of a solar plant

The second phase of the project will use satellite imaes to predict the weather in a particular region
